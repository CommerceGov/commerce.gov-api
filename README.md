## Content API for Commerce.gov
Content on Commerce.gov is exposed in two REST APIs available at https://api.commerce.gov/api/blogs and https://api.commerce.gov/api/news. Full documentation is located and maintained at https://www.commerce.gov/page/api-documentation-commercegov

As of 12/05/2015 Blog and News content is exposed in the API. We plan to add other content types as separate API resources.

## Periodic updates

The Commerce.gov API is under active, but not public, development. As such, API code is not currently made available publically. This Github repository will be used to collect and respond to feedback regarding the API and engage with developers interested in using the API.
