## Content API for Commerce.gov
Content on Commerce.gov is exposed in a REST API available at https://api.commece.gov/api/blog. Full documentation is located and maintained at https://www.commerce.gov/page/api-documentation-commercegov

As of 9/29/2015 only Blog content is exposed in the API, but we plan to add other content types such as News and media as separate API resources.

## Periodic updates

The Commerce.gov API is under active, but not public, development. As such, API code is not currently made available publically. This Github repository will be used to collect and respond to feedback regarding the API and engage with developers interested in using the API.
